##Projects

[Python Data Structures](https://github.com/celeen/PythonDataStructures) is an exploratory, hands on TDD based course I'm building and leading for PyLadies. It's a python adaptation of [Dave Astels' DBC Deep Dives](https://github.com/dastels/dbc-deep-dives). Both projects aim to provide a hands on way for anyone to explore the inner workings of data structures by implementing them in an OO/TDD environment.  

[Emotional Securities](https://github.com/celeen/EmotionalSecurities) is a web app that explores the realtionship between public opinion of a company, and its stock price. The initial site was constructed in 8 days, as a final project at Dev Bootcamp.
