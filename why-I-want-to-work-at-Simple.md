<h1>Hi Cat & Team!</h1>
<h2>My name is Celeen. I like what Simple does.</h2>
<div class = "column one">
<h3>Here's a little about me</h3>
<h4>I am a passionate, positive, problem solver.</h4>
<p>I believe in pessimism of the intellect, paired with optimism of the will. I love building things, especially beautiful, meaningful things, and solving problems. As much as I love and take pride in the results of my labor, I do it for the journey.</p>
<h4>I am a web developer.</h4>
<p>I just graduated from Dev Bootcamp, where I learned a ton about code, Ruby on Rails, and how to build beautiful, meaningful things for the web. I've made a lot of fun and interesting things, like  <a href = "http://emotionalsecurities.herokuapp.com">this project</a> about how people's feelings relate to stock prices, <a ref = "http://surveyunicorn.herokuapp.com">this</a> Survey Monkey clone, and <a href = "http://onetasteatatime.herokuapp.com">this</a> social networking website for foodies. Also, <a href = "http://www.linkedin.com/in/celeen">here's my Linked-In profile</a> if you'd like.</p>
<h4>I like other things too</h4>
<p>I love coding, and there are a ton of side projects I'm excited to work on. But I also am an adventurer; I love travel and have played music on seven continents. On request I can operate forklifts, or play a rad cover of "I want you back" on the ukulele. I love biking, and vegetables, and social advocacy. I love making friends, and have a "catch-more-flies-with-honey" view of activism and social engagement.</p>

<h3>Why I love Simple</h3>
<h4>You are passionate, positive, problem solvers.</h4>
<p>You noticed a ton of opportunity to provide innovative, incredibly useful solutions in an existing industry. Your customers' needs inspire your decisions, and your customers' needs remain your top priority. Your website communicates your commitment to straight-forward simplicity (and marks you as a well named service). You provide elegant, effective solutions with depth, that are easy to navigate. I love and admire the work that you do, and the fact that you do it so well.</p>
<h4>I've been there</h4>
<h5>(but really, who hasn't?)</h5>
<p>I am love budgeting, and have tried a ton of different systems (mint.com, YNAB, just taking cash out), but Simple has by far been the most effective, because it is so well designed on both the back end and the front end. I've been where your customers are, frustrated at traditional banks, and even at a lot of the "fixes" out there to help deal with traditional banks. I recognize that Simple is effective and oh-so-elegant because of the way the more complicated choices and equations are all kept behind the scenes, because of the way the layout gives uncluttered but clear choices, and because you respond to your customers needs.</p>
